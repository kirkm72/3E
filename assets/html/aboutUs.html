                <h2 class='about'>I build custom AR platform rifles from mild to wild. What began as a passion about firearms grew into getting a Federal Firearms License and creating my own brand of lower receiver. 
                    All rifles are built with quality made in the USA parts and are selected from what works. All the major components are manufactured in ISO 9000 certified plants right here in the United States.
                    My rifles are not only tested, but also used and abused. 
                        I try to break my demo rifles!
                    I start with our MIL SPEC lower receiver. 3E lowers have a tipped tension screw to adjust the tolerance between the upper and lower so they do not rattle or wiggle.
                    Our lowers also have a bolt catch setscrew instead of a pin like on an AR 10 platform lower. 
                        In addition, we also have a setscrew for the rear takedown pin. This allows you to take your buffer tube off without chasing a spring or detent for the rear takedown pin.
                        Why should you buy a rifle from me instead of a sporting goods store? With me, you know the barrel nut is properly torqued.
                    You know someone who wants the rifle to work properly assembled the rifle. You can speak to the person who built it if there is an issue, which there will not be!
                    In addition, I will work with you in getting your rifle set up for you!
                    We offer AR-15 rifles in multiple calibers such as 5.56 NATO, .223 Wylde, 22 Nosler, 300 Blackout, 6.5 Grendel, .224 Valkyrie, 6.8 SPC and 350 Legend. There are many others, but these are the popular ones. If you do not see something you like, let me know and I will build it.
                    I also build a 9mm Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC) that takes a Glock 17/34 magazine. In addition, my 9mm will hold the bolt open on the last shot.
                    I am a dealer for Ballistic Advantage, Velocity Triggers, Midwest Industries, Saturn Barrels, Shilen Barrels and Jewell Triggers. I can also offer gun cases and other accessories such as slings, swivels, lights etc.
                    All my rifles come with assembly warrantied by me. If it does not work right, contact me and I will make it right. Optics installed by me are warranted by the manufacture. You must register your optic with the manufacture to get the warranty.
